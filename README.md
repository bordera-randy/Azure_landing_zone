# Azure Landing Zone Setup using Terraform

This README provides instructions for setting up an Azure landing zone using Terraform. The landing zone is a set of best practices and guidelines for organizing and securing your Azure resources. Using Terraform to define and deploy the infrastructure ensures reproducibility and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Azure landing zone with Terraform, you must have the following prerequisites:

- **Azure Subscription**: An active Azure subscription where resources will be provisioned.
- **Terraform**: Install Terraform on your local machine or CI/CD pipeline. You can download it from [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
- **Azure CLI**: The Azure CLI should be installed to authenticate Terraform to Azure. Install it from [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- **Service Principal with Azure Permissions**: A service principal with sufficient permissions to deploy resources on Azure (such as Contributor or Owner role).
- **Terraform State Backend**: Optionally configure a remote backend for storing Terraform state, such as Azure Storage.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/azure-landing-zone-terraform.git
   cd azure-landing-zone-terraform
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Azure**

   Ensure you're logged into Azure using the Azure CLI:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

   If you're using a service principal, use the following command:

   ```bash
   az login --service-principal -u <app_id> -p <password_or_certificate> --tenant <tenant_id>
   ```

3. **Install Terraform**

   If Terraform is not already installed, follow the instructions for your platform on the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

## Terraform Configuration

The Azure landing zone Terraform configuration is organized into several modules and files. The key components are:

- **`main.tf`**: This file contains the core Terraform configuration that provisions the resources.
- **`variables.tf`**: Define input variables for customization of the landing zone.
- **`outputs.tf`**: Define outputs that provide details after deployment.
- **`providers.tf`**: Configures the Azure provider for Terraform.

Example structure:

```plaintext
.
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── providers.tf
└── modules/
    ├── networking/
    ├── security/
    └── compute/
```

### Providers Configuration (`providers.tf`)

Make sure to configure the provider with your Azure subscription and authentication method:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

provider "azurerm" {
  alias           = "secondary"
  subscription_id = var.secondary_subscription_id
  tenant_id       = var.tenant_id
  client_id       = var.client_id
  client_secret   = var.client_secret
}
```

---

## Variables Configuration

Define the input variables in `variables.tf` to customize your landing zone. These can include:

- **`resource_group_name`**: The name of the resource group.
- **`location`**: The Azure region where resources will be deployed.
- **`subscription_id`**: Azure subscription ID for resource deployment.
- **`vnet_address_space`**: Virtual Network address space.
- **`security_group_name`**: The name for a security group or network security rules.

Example:

```hcl
variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the resource group"
  type        = string
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure region where resources will be deployed"
  default     = "East US"
}

variable "vnet_address_space" {
  description = "The address space for the virtual network"
  default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

## Deploying the Landing Zone

### Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize the Terraform working directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

This command installs the necessary providers and prepares the environment for deployment.

### Plan the Deployment

Generate an execution plan by running:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

This will show what resources Terraform plans to create or modify.

### Apply the Terraform Configuration

To apply the configuration and create resources on Azure, run:

```bash
terraform apply "tfplan"
```

Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

### Monitor Deployment

Terraform will begin provisioning the Azure resources based on your configuration. You can monitor the progress in the terminal.

---

## Post-Deployment Steps

Once the deployment is complete, you may want to:

- **Verify Resources**: Check the Azure portal to verify that resources have been deployed successfully.
- **Configure Security and Access Control**: Review and configure Azure role-based access control (RBAC), network security groups (NSGs), and any other security measures.
- **Integrate Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging for the deployed resources using Azure Monitor or other logging solutions.

---

## Cleanup

To destroy the infrastructure and clean up resources from your Azure subscription, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: If Terraform cannot authenticate with Azure, ensure that you've correctly logged in with `az login` and that your service principal has the appropriate permissions.
- **Resource Creation Errors**: Check the error messages in the Terraform output. Common issues include insufficient permissions, invalid configurations, or missing resources in your Azure subscription.
- **State Locking**: If you're using a remote backend (e.g., Azure Storage for state), ensure that no other Terraform processes are using the state file simultaneously.
